# Flutter Chat UI

Actively maintained, community-driven chat UI implementation with an optional [Firebase BaaS](https://github.com/flyerhq/flutter_firebase_chat_core).

<img></img>

Flyer Chat is a platform for creating in-app chat experiences using Flutter or [React Native](https://github.com/flyerhq/react-native-chat-ui). This repository contains chat UI implementation for Flutter.

* **Free, open-source and community-driven**. We offer no paid plugins and strive to create an easy-to-use, almost drop-in chat experience for any application. Contributions are more than welcome! Please read our [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

* **Backend agnostic**. You can choose the backend you prefer. But if you don't have one, we provide our own free and open-source [Firebase implementation](https://github.com/flyerhq/flutter_firebase_chat_core), which can be used to create a working chat in minutes. We are also working on our more advanced SaaS and self-hosted solutions.

* **Customizable**. Supports custom themes, locales and more. Check our [documentation](https://flyer.chat) for the info. More options are on the way, let us know if something is missing.

* **Minimum dependencies**. Our packages are lightweight. Use your favourite packages for selecting images, opening files etc. See the [example](https://github.com/flyerhq/flutter_chat_ui/blob/main/example/lib/main.dart) for possible implementation.
